# Functions

**OVERVIEW** Functions are fundamental to the study of calculus. In this chapter we review
what functions are and how they are pictured as graphs, how they are combined and trans-
formed, and ways they can be classified. We review the trigonometric functions, and we
discuss misrepresentations that can occur when using calculators and computers to obtain
a function’s graph. We also discuss inverse, exponential, and logarithmic functions. The
real number system, Cartesian coordinates, straight lines, circles, parabolas, and ellipses
are reviewed in the Appendices.

## 1.1 Functions and Their Graphs

Functions are a tool for describing the real world in mathematical terms. A function can be
represented by an equation, a graph, a numerical table, or a verbal description; we will use
all four representations throughout this book. This section reviews these function ideas.
Functions; Domain and Range
The temperature at which water boils depends on the elevation above sea level (the boiling
point drops as you ascend). The interest paid on a cash investment depends on the length of
time the investment is held. The area of a circle depends on the radius of the circle. The dis-
tance an object travels at constant speed along a straight-line path depends on the elapsed time.
In each case, the value of one variable quantity, say y, depends on the value of another
variable quantity, which we might call x. We say that “y is a function of x” and write this
symbolically as

> y = ƒ(x) (“y equals ƒ of x”).

In this notation, the symbol ƒ represents the function, the letter x is the independent variable
representing the input value of ƒ, and y is the dependent variable or output value of ƒ at x.
## DEFINITION :
A function ƒ from a set D to a set Y is a rule that assigns a unique
(single) element ƒ(x)∊Y to each element x∊D.
The set D of all possible input values is called the domain of the function. The set of
all output values of ƒ(x) as x varies throughout D is called the range of the function. The
range may not include every element in the set Y. The domain and range of a function can
be any sets of objects, but often in calculus they are sets of real numbers interpreted as
points of a coordinate line. (In Chapters 13–16, we will encounter functions for which the
elements of the sets are points in the coordinate plane or i)
